# Ontodbench

OntoDBench offers DBA the possibility to estimate the structuredness of her/his dataset and evaluate the scalability of the three main storage layouts of ontology-based data on its real datasets and workload. Then, according to her/his functionality and scalability requirements, DBA may choose the adequate OBDB. OntoDBench supports the following functionalities: 

* the evaluation of the characteristics of the real datasets, 
* the identification of the relevant storage models for a given OBDB, 
* the expression of the workload queries according to the three representations and (4) the evaluation of the queries performance.
